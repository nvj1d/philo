we have 5 philos
we have 5 forks
the philo can eat and think
to eat must have two forks

-->resource Hieararchy solution:

think until the small number fork is available --> pick it up
think until the large number fork is available --> pick it up
eat for a fixed amount of time 
put the small number fork down
put the large number fork down
repeat ...
